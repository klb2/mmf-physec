This repository is accompanying the paper "Securing Data in Multimode Fibers by
Exploiting Mode-Dependent Light Propagation Effects" (S. Rothe, K.-L. Besser,
D. Krause, R. Kuschmierz, N.  Koukourakis, E. Jorswieck, J. Czarske. Research,
vol. 6: 0065, Jan. 2023.
[DOI:10.34133/research.0065](https://doi.org/10.34133/research.0065)).

The idea is to make all calculations, simulations, and presented results
publicly available to the reader and, therefore, reproducible.



## File List
The following files are provided in this repository:

- [BPSK Secrecy
  Rate.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/klb2/mmf-physec/HEAD?labpath=BPSK%20Secrecy%20Rate.ipynb):
  Jupyter notebook that contains an interactive version of the simulations.
- `run.sh`: Bash script that reproduces the figures presented in the paper.
- `statistic.sh`: Bash script that reproduces the results which are averaged
  over multiple measurements.
- `svd_precoding.py`: Python module that calculates the secrecy rate with SVD
  precoding.
- `no_precoding.py`: Python module that calculates the secrecy rate when no
  precoding at the transmitter is performed.
- `data_transmission.py`: Python module that shows the measured data
  transmission of the TU Dresden logo and performs the MC simulation with an
  additional polar wiretap code.
- `waterfilling.py`: Python module that solves the optimization problem of
  optimal power allocation for parallel BSCs.
- `show_capacity_statistics.py`: Python module that averages the results of
  multiple MMF measurements and plots them. (Automatically called at the end of
  `statistic.sh`.)
- `read_matrices.py`: Python module that contains functions for reading the
  channel matrices from the measurement files.
- `util.py`: Some utility functions like setting up the logging etc.

### Measurements
In the `measurements/` directory, one can find the measured MMF channel
matrices that where used to obtain the results.
All measurements were performed on a 55-mode MMF of 10m length, where an
eavesdropper is physically coupled (50:50 coupling).
A detailed description can be found in the paper.

- `mmf-measurement.mat`: Channel matrix measurements of Alice to Bob and Alice
  to Eve, both with and without precoding at the transmitter
- `data-measurement.mat`: Measurements of the transmission of the TU Dresden
  logo


## Usage
### Running it online
The easiest way is to use services like [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to run
the notebook online. Simply navigate to
[https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/klb2/mmf-physec/HEAD](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/klb2/mmf-physec/HEAD)
to run the notebooks in your browser without setting everything up locally.

### Local Installation
If you want to run it locally on your machine, Python3 and Jupyter are needed.
The present code was developed and tested with the following versions:
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter 1.0
- notebook 6.4
- numpy 1.22
- scipy 1.8
- Pandas 1.4.1
- h5py 3.6
- digcommpy 0.9

Make sure you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on
your computer.
You can then install the required packages (including Jupyter) by running
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the needed packages which are listed in the requirements 
file. 

Finally, you can run the Jupyter notebook with
```bash
jupyter notebook 'BPSK Secrecy Rate.ipynb'
```

You can also recreate the figures from the paper by running
```bash
bash run.sh
```
